GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

With [graphql-hemera](https://github.com/hemerajs/graphql-hemera) we provide a simple setup to demonstrate how to use Hemera for resolving your GraphQL queries. Because of the flexibility of GraphQL you have to deal with many resolvers hemera can provide you a way to manage this in a very simple and efficient way. Combine GraphQL with the power of pattern matching.
